I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before cioming to Stanford, I spent two years as a 
<br>programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product
<br>designed to improve communication and coordination within small projnect teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for
<br>Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifestyle-from initial product conception through the actual product
<br>launch.<br><br>
I have a Ph.D.from the University of California, Irvine where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on 
<br>process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree fro Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial 
<br>Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.<br>
