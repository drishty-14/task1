<h3>My Trip To California</h3>
It was a long,quip trip. We loaded our vehicle and headed to Northern California for<br>
the 4th jukly weekend for a family reunion. We then made haste to Magic Mountain.<br>
By the time we returned home,we had traveled some 1,300 miles in three and one<br>
half days.

After a year's preparation,it was time to go backpacking with the Boy Scouts. We flew<br>
to Colorado Springs,toured the Air Force Acadamy,Pike's Peak,Garden Of The Gods,<br>
and the Olympic training center. We chartered a bus to the Philmont Scout Ranch in<br>
Northern New Mexico and began our 60 mile backpack trek. Afterwards, we boarded <br>
Amtrack's and rode the rails to Kingman,and then chartered a bus home.
<h3>My Trip To The Mid West</h3>
My wife and I drove our son's little red Ford Mustang some 2,900 miles to him in<br>
Indiana where he attends college. In route,we stopped at Nauvoo,Illinois,and<br>
Detroit,Michigan. We then boarded Amrak in Chicago,and rode it to Salt Lake City,<br>
where we boarded a bus which returned us to Las Vegas.
